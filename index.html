          <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>I have been around computers since a young age. At age 11 I learned <em>HTML 4</em> to make awful 90s Pokémon
            websites complete with flashing gifs and the &lt;marquee&gt; tag. I later made <em>popular game mods</em> for various games popular in the early 2000s.</p>
          <p>In 2010 I graduated from <em>Texas A&M University</em> with a degree in <em>Civil Engineering</em>. My specialty was simulating traffic, rainfall, and runoff patterns to help build sustainable communities. </p>
          <p>Upon graduation I was commissioned as a US Army Corps of Engineer officer. I spent six years as a supervisor and project manager on various engineering projects around the world.  I have led teams as small as <em>3</em> and as large as
            <em>180</em>. I served as lead on <em>$18 million-dollar projects</em> involving <em>400 people</em> and
            made decisions that permanently impacted people’s lives. I know what it means to be a <em>servant
              leader</em> and how to forge the <em>next generation of leaders</em> to replace me.</p>
          <p>I have always maintained a game development hobby and have used <em>C#</em> and <em>Unity3D</em> since 2015. After I finished my Army career I decided to pivot and turn my hobby into a career by becoming a <em>Software Engineer.</em> </p>
