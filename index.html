            <h3>&gt; My Story</h3>

            <p class="inline-p">
              I have always been an <em>engineer</em>. At age 11 I learned <em>HTML 4</em> to make awful 90s Pokémon
              websites complete with flashing gifs and the &lt;marquee&gt; tag. I later made <em>popular game mods</em>
              and eventually graduated from <em>Texas A&M University</em> with a degree in <em>Civil Engineering</em>
              specializing in traffic modeling simulation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Six years as a US Army Corps of Engineers officer infused me with a passion to <em>lead</em> people and
              <em>manage</em> challenging <em>projects</em>. I have led teams as small as <em>3</em> and as large as
              <em>180</em>. I served as lead on <em>$18 million-dollar projects</em> involving <em>400 people</em> and
              made decisions that permanently impacted people’s lives. I know what it means to be a <em>servant
                leader</em> and how to forge the <em>next generation of leaders</em> to replace me.
            </p>
            <p>
              After finishing my Army career, I focused back on my roots creating software. Seizing on my game
              development hobby using <em>C#</em> and <em>Unity3D</em>, I worked tirelessly to build the skills
              necessary to change careers. Eventually, the hard work paid off and <em>Penn State University</em>
              accepted me in their <em>Masters of Software Engineering</em> program. I continue to learn and expand my
              skill set so I can be ready to begin my career in <em>May 2020</em>.
